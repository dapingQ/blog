title: Abstract of How to Quantify the Optical Field

## Wave-particle duality and vacuum fluctuation

During the steps of quantization of optical field, the most essential of the wave function itself, as we name it as so-called *second-quantization*.

However, there is no way to solve the Maxwell Equations with a ground state where the eigenenergy is ${1/2}\hbar\omega$. It is trival that the Maxwell Equation can only can give us such things.

1. plane-wave solution, which gives the oscilation of wave along the propagaton direction along with time.
    
    $$ (\nabla^2 + \frac{1}{c^2} ) ~ \textbf{H} =0 $$
    $$ \nabla^2 + \frac{1}{c^2} ) ~ \textbf{E} =0 $$


2. transverse field requirement

$$ \nabla\cdot~\bold{B}=0 $$

hence, $ \hat{e_{\sigma}} \cdot \textbf{k} =0 $, gives us the two polization mode.
