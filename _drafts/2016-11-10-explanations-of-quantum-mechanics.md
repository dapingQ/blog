title: Three basic mathematical descriptions in primary quantum mechanics
---

Quantum physics is fundamental for almost all the modern physics branches in this century, but during the last several decades, physicists haven't even found a unique explanation about quantum theory.

## Copenhagen interpretation
Widely accepted or we say adopted theory is so-called *Copenhagen interpretation*, but it hasn't convinced every physicist especially the most wield part *measurement*, it simply ignores the relation between observers and quantum states and alternatively says, it is one of the principles of quantum mechanics. Things should not go like that and some scientists believe that there should be some physics deeper to the nature which answers the *measurement loophole* better than *Copenhagen interpretation*.

But first, let us talk about the *Copenhagen interpretation*. It usually include the below three *principles*.

- identicality, the particles in the nanoscale world are classified into several categories, and in each category (by their statistical characters), they are totally same as each other. For instance, an electron existing somewhere in your body is *identical to* an electron on the Mars. And by any method, you can not tell the differences between two identical particles which is named as *indistinguishbility*.
- superposition, quantum state is not classical object which follows the single worldline, which is an aspect in the theoretical mechanics. It is somehow closer to a spinning coin and you never know which side it may finally flip into.
- measurement, once the observer *measures* the quantum state, it collapses into one of the eigenstate.

First of all is the Schrodinger's wave function, which is the most popular theory among the earliest quantum physicists. 
According to this theory, wave and particle are both essential properties for the quanta. For example, as a light beam emit from laser cavity, it behaves like plat wave. On contrast with classic assumption, when it comes to split experiment, light can act like particle and it seems that it will follow some certain path, which we call path of particle, and the path is the range of the calculation to keep the total possibility that particle will appear, in other words, be measured and collapse to a certain state, is normalized.

Another theory was funded by Heisenberg at his twenties. He thought that when we take the measurement of the quantum system, the particle or wave will collapse to a state and the quantum state have the certain amplitudes, which indicates that each received state will be one part of the previous state. However, due to uncertainty law, we have no information on which state we will get from the measurement. After several mathematical abstract summaries, this opinion was developed as matrix theory of quantum physics.

Last theory may a little later than previous two, it was Feynman's path calculus theory. As we discussed above, if we consider the quantum state as a particle, only the possible paths will be satisfied and different mechanical and dynamical functions can be expressed by a simple calculus of those paths. This idea is much more modern and sometimes more useful when you handle a complicated physics model.

In summary, confusion is always coexisting with development, especially topics of modern physics. In order to figure out all the universe mysteries, we are supposed to keep expanding the boundary of physics.
