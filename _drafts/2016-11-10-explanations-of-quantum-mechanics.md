title: Explanations of modern quantum theory
---

Since different branches of physics have established during last century, it turns out that quantum physics has become a more and more important tool to solve the various kinds physics problem. However, as Einstein pointed out the photon hypothesis of light, many explanations to quantum mechanics have also been put forward.

First of all is the Schrodinger's wave function, which is the most popular theory among the earliest quantum physicists. According to this theory, wave and particle are both essential components for the quantum phenomena. When a beam of light emitted from laser cavity, it behaves like plat wave, which takes the form of triangle function multiplied by a time harmonic factor. On contrast with classic assumption, when it comes to split experiment, light can act like particle and it seems that it will follow some certain path, which we call path of particle and the path is the range of the calculation to keep the total possibility that particle will appear, in other words, be measured and collapse to a certain state, is normalized.

Another theory was funded by Heisenberg at his twenties. He thought that when we take the measurement of the quantum system, the particle or wave will collapse to a state and the quantum state have the certain amplitudes, which indicates that each received state will be one part of the previous state. However, due to uncertainty law, we have no information on which state we will get from the measurement. After several mathematical abstract summaries, this opinion was developed as matrix theory of quantum physics.

Last theory may a little later than previous two, it was Feynman's path calculus theory. As we discussed above, if we consider the quantum state as a particle, only the possible paths will be satisfied and different mechanical and dynamical functions can be expressed by a simple calculus of those paths. This idea is much more modern and sometimes more useful when you handle a complicated physics model.

In summary, confusion is always coexisting with development, especially topics of modern physics. In order to figure out all the universe mysteries, we are supposed to keep expanding the boundary of physics.
