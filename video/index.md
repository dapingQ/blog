# Madness and Civilization

In every fall, Professor Hu Cheng from School of History has a course named *Disease, Bodies and Modernity*. He has visited Yale University and was left deep imperssion of their different homework, no thesis or presentation, but a short documentary concerning this course. The whole class were devided into four groups and I was one of the members of *Madness and Civilization*.

As a result of our gruop, this vedio consists four parts, introdution, Ancient Greece, Renaissance and Classical Period (which is defined by Foucault).

*Madness and Civilization* is theme of one of the most famous works of Foucault, *Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age*.

> The book discussed how West European society had dealt with madness,
> arguing that it was a social construct distinct from mental illness. 
> Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: 
> the Renaissance, the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience.
